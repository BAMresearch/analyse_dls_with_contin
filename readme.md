This repository contains Python code and a Jupyter Notebook
running the original [CONTIN program by S. Provencher](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0010-4655(82)90174-6)
on every DLS measurement (dynamic light scattering, aka. photon correlation spectroscopy, PCS)
read from `*.ASC` files at the specified angle found in the given subfolders.
The expected input file format is `ALV-7004 CGS-8F Data` which is found at the first line of each file.
